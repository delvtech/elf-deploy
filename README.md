# ELF Deploy

The purpose of this repo is automate the setup of a local testnet to run the elf-contracts.

## How to run

### Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:element-fi/elf-deploy.git
```

### Get the contracts

```bash
$ sh scripts/load-elf-contracts.sh
```

### Run the hardhat local testnet

Install npm packages

```bash
$ npm install
```

Compile the contracts

```bash
$ npx hardhat compile
```

Run the Hardhat Runtime Environment

```bash
$ npx hardhat node
```

(This makes a local testnet at http://localhost:8545/ and chain id 31337)

Deploy the contracts

```bash
$ npx hardhat run scripts/src/main.ts --network localhost --no-compile
```

Now all the contracts are loaded to the local testnet!

### Run the frontend

```bash
$ sh scripts/load-efi-frontend.sh
$ sh scripts/start-frontend.sh
```

Now the frontend is running and talking to the local testnet. You'll need to grab the private key
associated with the userAddres in addresses.json. It should be the 2nd key created by hardhat,
which is printed to the screen after you run `npx hardhat node`.
